This game was made as a result of a team effort of 4 students during a 2-month agile development period for the Game Design course at William & Mary in Spring 2025. In it, you play as a William & Mary senior during finals week who must rush across campus in order to get to your finals on time and graduate. Written in C++, this project was foundational in building my teamwork and version control skills, as well as sharpening my understanding of agile development in a deadline-filled environment.
